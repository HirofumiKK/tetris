Tetris game with some special pieces having special effects

The normal pieces are the following shapes: I, L, J, T, O, S, Z.

The special pieces with special effects are the following:
  - Vapor: it vaporizes nearby pieces. Score is not added by this effect.
  - Foam: When it's dropped, it fills up nearby open spaces. If a row is filled due to this effect,
        the row disappers and score is added.
  - Crazy: The way it rotates and shifts right/left is the opposite of that of the other pieces.
  
This project was an assignment in CS 32 in UCLA. It was entirely made from scratch by me in spring of 2018.
